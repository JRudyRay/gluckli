Code base for operation of Microfluorimiter setup.


## ðŸš€ Quickstart

Set up the project in one line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git && cd your-repo && ./setup_env.sh
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment in `.venv/`
- Activate it
- Upgrade pip
- Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`

Once set up, activate the environment with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To install a new package and update the requirements:

```bash
pip install <package-name>
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To deactivate the environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
